# About

Hi, I’m Vicky, a German Graphic Design Freelancer living abroad in Sydney. Passionate about travel and exploring new countries and cultures. I want to share my experience with you and give you some impressions to go out and travel the world.

Working as a Freelancer makes travelling more flexible and you can combine both. If you’re a small business, startup or just someone who needs a great design, feel free to contact me. I’m happy to work with you!
